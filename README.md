# `gdb`  

I had already found `gdb` installed on Fedora 25 Workstation Linux.  Note that Mac OS X uses `lldb`. 

However, `gdb` did prompt me to install "Missing separate debuginfos."  In SuperUser, I did this:

```  
sudo dnf debuginfo-install glibc-2.24-10.fc25.x86_64  
```   
which installed  
```  
  glibc-debuginfo.x86_64 2.24-10.fc25                                           
  glibc-debuginfo-common.x86_64 2.24-10.fc25     
```

```
gdb --batch --ex run --ex bt --ex q --args ./ex3
```  
This command tells it to run all the options.  

### `gdb` variables

The "weird" `$NN` in front, at first, are `gdb` variables, that you can access for convenience, later.

## `gdb` commands (API guide)

Compilation of `gdb` commands I use  

### `break`  

[`break` *location*](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Set-Breaks.html), where, according to the `gdb` documentation, *location*, can be specified in [3 ways](): [Linespec](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Linespec-Locations.html#Linespec-Locations), [Explicit](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Explicit-Locations.html#Explicit-Locations), [Address](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Address-Locations.html#Address-Locations).    

`break` on a line: 

 The command to set a breakpoint is break. If you only have one source file, you can set a breakpoint like so:
```  
    (gdb) break 19
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x80483f8: file test.c, line 19
```  
If you have more than one file, you must give the break command a filename as well:
```  
    (gdb) break test.c:19
    Breakpoint 2 at 0x80483f8: file test.c, line 19  
```  

cf. [4. How do I use breakpoints? ](http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbbreak.html)

### `c` `continue`

https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/28475.pdf

### `delete [breakpoint]` [delete a break point]() 

### [`disassemble`](http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/disassemble)  

Disassembles a function or function fragment (into machine instruction).  

** Syntax ** 
```  
disassemble
disassemble [Function]
disassemble [Address]
disassemble [Start],[End]
disassemble [Function],+[Length]
disassemble [Address],+[Length]
disassemble /m [...]
disassemble /r [...]  
```  

** Parameters **  
  
`Function`  
    Specifies the function to disassemble. If specified, the disassemble command will produce the disassembly output of the entire function.  
`Address`  
    Specifies the address inside a function to disassemble. Note that when only one address is specified, this command will disassemble the entire function that includes the given address, including the instructions above it.  
`Start/End`  
    Specifies starting and ending addresses to disassemble. If this form is used, the command won't disassemble the entire function, but only the instructions between the starting and ending addresses.  
`Length`  
    Specifies the amount of bytes to disassemble starting from the given address or function.   
`/m`  
    When this option is specified, the disassemble command will show the source lines that correspond to the disassembled instructions.  
`/r`  
    When this option is specified, the disassemble command will show the raw byte values of all disassembled instructions.   


e.g. 
```  
disassemble main  
```  

### `i` , `i[nfo]`

`i[nfo] b` -	[List breakpoints](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/stkintro/Useful_commands_gdb.html)

### [`i r`](http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/info_registers), `info registers`  

Displays the contents of general-purpose processor registers.  

#### Syntax
```  
info registers
info registers [Register name]
```  

#### Parameters

*Register name*  
    If specified, the info registers command will show the contents of a given register only. If omitted, the command will show the contents of all general-purpose CPU registers. 

e.g. `info registers eax`, `info registers cx`    


### 'info frame'  

`info frame` to show the stack frame info

cf. [how can one see content of stack with gdb](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7848771/how-can-one-see-content-of-stack-with-gdb)

### `kill`  
Kill the program being debugged? (y or n) y


### `p`  

Finding (memory) address of a variable, e.g.  
```  
p &arr
``` 


cf. [Finding address of a local variable in C with GDB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10835822/finding-address-of-a-local-variable-in-c-with-gdb)


### `s`, `step`  
Single stepping until exit from function, which has no line number information.


### [`x`](http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/x)  

`x` displays the memory contents at a given address using the specified format.  `x` can also display memory contents of a given *register*.  

*Syntax* 
``` 
	x [Address expression]
	x/[Format] [Address expression]
	x /[Length][Format] [Address expression]  
```  

*Parameters*  

- `Address expression` - can be a specified memory address, or C/C++ expression evaluating to address, or registers (e.g. `$rbp`, and pseudoregisters (e.g. `$pc`).  
- `Length` - specifies number of elements that'll be displayed by this command `x`  
- `Format` = if specified, output format specified by  
	* o - octal
    * x - hexadecimal
    * d - decimal
    * u - unsigned decimal
    * t - binary
    * f - floating point
    * a - address
    * c - char
    * s - string
    * i - instruction  

	The following size modifiers are supported:  

    * b - byte
    * h - halfword (16-bit value)
    * w - word (32-bit value)
    * g - giant word (64-bit value)
