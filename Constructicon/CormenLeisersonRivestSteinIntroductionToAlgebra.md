# 14. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming typically applies to optimization problesm.
1. Characterize structure of optimal solution.
2. Recursively define value of optimal solujtion.
3. Compute value of optimal solution, typically in bottom up fashion.
4. Construct optimal solution from computed information.
